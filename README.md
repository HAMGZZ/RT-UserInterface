# RT-UserInterface
Real-Time user interface for projects that need things like rotary encoders, led's, fan control and the like.

This code is currently heavily based off sparkfun's [qwiic_twist](https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_Qwiic_Twist_Arduino_Library) i2c device. However, changes will be made as I need them. For example, i have added a pwm fan control and whatnot. I will also eventually include schematics and whatnot... I am also looking to change the MCU that is used to a more updated one.
